# Ancient Wonders
Practice application to implement code via Angular, mySQL etc
This application opens a home page with a list of the seven ancient wonders of the world.
Each wonder is its own component and will dynamically be routed on same page when clicked on the menu.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.5.

### This README file will be updated as more features are added to the app.

--All information about the wonders are from National Geographic--

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
